A handy tool to dump recipes from Minecraft.

## Usage

- Commands:
  - `/dump recipes`: Dump all recipes.
  - `/dump tags items`: Dump all item tags.
  - `/dump tags blocks`: Dump all block tags.
  - `/dump tags fluids`: Dump all fluid tags.
  - `/dump all`: Dump all tags.

Outputs will be in `[game directory]/dumps/`.

## Future Plans

In the future (as I am coming back to this), I plan to:

- [ ] Port to Architectury
- [ ] Support at least 1.18 through 1.20.5 (and 1.21)
- [ ] Make a web service to view recipes and tags (including recipes for mods like Create and Mekanism), and calculate base requirements
